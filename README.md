# GeoPlanarNet
## A simple and small.NET library for computational planar geometry.Â 
The GeoPlanarNet library's primary function is manipulating basic geometrical primitives like points, lines, triangles, and rectangles in 2D space. Implemented both simple (like finding the intersection point of two lines) and complex (like checking if the point in the circle sector) methods. All methods have overloads to work with standart .NET graphics classes: Point, PointF, Rect, RectF.

Because readability and simplicity of the code were the key objectives, speed and robustness were not given top emphasis. Global tolerance property is used for proximity checking, not an exact robust algorithms.
